      <p>Welcome to my BIG A$$ Toy Collection. I've been collecting toys off and on since the 90's, which stemmed from collecting comics (I have a pretty good sized comic collection, a little over 18,000 comics) which I don't collect anymore but I do still collect toys. My main focus these days, are old and new Star Wars toys. I can't tell you why. With comics, you read them and then bag and board them and then put them away. Toys, you buy and don't open them, maybe display them if you have the space or you store them away, like a squirrel, for a rainy day. I think now it's the nostalgia of having some of the things I had (or didn't have but wanted) when I was a kid and some of it's buying that one figure, that one toy, that's going to end up being really valuable (just like with comics), kind of like winning the lottery.</p>

      <p>Now I catalog everything I have and buy because:
      </p><ol>
        <li>So I don't forget what I have and buy it again (which I've definitely done).</li>
        <li>So I know what to still get or what I'm still missing.</li>
        <li>To have everything ready to eventually sell when I retire and</li>
        <li>To share with people that like to check them out.</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>

      <p>So, I've organized everything and posted it here. Toys can be viewed through the navigation above. You either access all the toys in 'All Toys' and filter through them or they can be viewed in 'Toys by Company', which organizes all the toys by company and they can still be filtered through.</p>

      <p>I do own all of these toys and I've taken every picture myself, except for any carded figure that remains in a sealed package and for that I used the image from that toy's website. Each toy is mint or near mint in the original packaging unless otherwise noted.</p>
